🧠💻 Full Roadmap: Reverse Engineering + Cheat Tool Development
📍 Stage 1: System Programming Fundamentals
Topic	Goal
✅ C++ (Intermediate to Advanced)	Understand pointers, memory allocation, WinAPI, DLLs
🔄 Assembly Language (x86/x64)	Read disassembled code, understand how instructions map to behavior
💻 Windows Internals	Learn how memory, processes, threads, and handles work on Windows
📘 Suggested Resources:	

LearnCpp.com (C++)

“Windows Internals” by Mark Russinovich (deep dive)

x64dbg tutorials (YouTube or guided walkthroughs)

🧪 Stage 2: Debugging + Reverse Engineering Tools
Tool	Use
🧠 IDA Pro / Ghidra	Disassemble and analyze binaries to reverse unknown code
🛠 x64dbg / OllyDbg	Set breakpoints, trace execution, step through instructions
🧪 Cheat Engine	Scan memory, find values, pointers, and experiment (practice here first)
🐛 Process Hacker / Process Explorer	View running processes and inspect memory usage

🔁 Practice: Start with simple offline games or CrackMe challenges

🧠 Stage 3: Reverse Engineering Practice
What to Learn	How
🎯 Finding static & dynamic addresses	Use CE or x64dbg to scan & trace memory changes
🔍 Function call analysis	Step through assembly, see what each function does
🧩 Lua VM internal reverse	Understand how Lua is embedded, exposed to scripts

🔐 Stage 4: Anti-Cheat Bypassing (Advanced)
Anti-Cheat Concepts	Techniques
🚫 Hook detection	Learn inline hooking and trampoline hooks
👀 Memory integrity checks	Use manual mapping or unlinking DLLs from PEB
🧪 Kernel-level checks (Byfron)	Avoid user-mode detection via stealth injections
🧱 HWID / VM detection evasion	Use anti-VM techniques in VMs (for testing only)
🧰 Tools You Might Use:	

Blackbone library (for injection)

Kernel-mode drivers (VERY advanced)

Manual DLL mapper (vs LoadLibrary)

⚠️ Warning: Anything involving anti-cheat bypassing must never be used on live systems like Roblox. Always test in isolated VMs for learning.

🧠 Stage 5: Building Your Own Tools (Safely)
Tool	Purpose
🛠 DLL Injector	Inject DLLs into a process like RobloxPlayerBeta.exe
🧩 Internal Lua executor	Create a bridge to the Lua VM and execute custom Lua
🛡 Manual mapper injector	Avoid detection from LoadLibrary or Windows APIs
📘 Learn From:	

Guided videos on making DLL injectors

GitHub cheat loaders (for educational reverse engineering)

Windows API documentation (OpenProcess, WriteProcessMemory, VirtualAllocEx, etc.)

⚠️ Safety & Legality
Important Tips	Why
🧪 Use a VM (VirtualBox/VMware)	Never test on your main system
⚠️ Never release cheats or sell them	This is highly illegal and breaks ToS, laws, and ethics
🔐 Never touch kernel drivers unless you fully understand what you’re doing	Can BSOD your PC or be flagged as malware
🧘 Focus on skill-building	These skills are valuable in ethical hacking, malware research, game dev, and security

🎓 You’ll Be Learning:
How memory works inside games

How to “speak” to compiled code through disassembly

How Lua and C++ interact (especially in embedded VMs)

How anti-cheats detect and block unwanted behavior

How to stay stealthy, careful, and ethical
